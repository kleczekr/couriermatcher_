# Wut?

It's a small JSON file listing couriers along with their typical tracking number formats. It also has a Track123 courier code which can be helpful if you are working with Track123 API to get delivery statuses.

# Why?

The file was created for my app, but I thought it might be useful for others as well. Getting some community input is welcome, just introduce changes in the courier_matcher.json and send a pull request.

# How?

Ideally I would like to add a separate field with RegEx to match couriers by tracking number, but for now it's just a list of typical formats. If you have a better idea, please let me know.
